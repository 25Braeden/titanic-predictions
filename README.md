# Titanic Survival Prediction

![Titanic Image](titanic.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a machine learning application that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic based on various passenger attributes. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this project aims to answer the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"

## Project Description

The Titanic Survival Prediction project is part of the Kaggle competition [link to Kaggle competition], where the goal is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The project is implemented in Python using popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. These files contain passenger information such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more. The `train.csv` file also includes the target variable "Survived," which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).

## Features

The following features are used in the prediction model:

- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male or female)
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

# Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd titanic-survival-prediction

# Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the machine learning model and make predictions.
